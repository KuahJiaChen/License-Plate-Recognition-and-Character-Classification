# License Plate Recognition and Character Classification

This repository contains code and files related to two interconnected projects: License Plate Recognition and Character Classification.

## Introduction

### License Plate Recognition Project

The License Plate Recognition project focuses on developing algorithms for locating and recognizing car license plates. There are two algorithms implemented for this project:

1. Locating Car License Plate: Algorithm 1
   - Implementation: `License_Plate_Recognition_Algorithm_1.ipynb`
   - Description: This notebook contains Algorithm 1, which focuses on locating car license plates. It utilizes a combination of image processing techniques and feature extraction methods to identify the position of license plates in a given set of car images.

2. Locating Car License Plate: Algorithm 2
   - Implementation: `License_Plate_Recognition_Algorithm_2.ipynb`
   - Description: This notebook contains Algorithm 2, which also focuses on locating car license plates. It utilizes a combination of image processing techniques and feature extraction methods to identify the position of license plates in a given set of car images.

### Character Classification Project

The Character Classification project utilizes a three-layered neural network to classify characters on typical Malaysian car number plates. The project is divided into two parts:

1. Dataset Preparation and Preprocessing
   - Implementation: `Character_Classification_DatasetPreprocessing.ipynb`
   - Description: This notebook focuses on preparing and preprocessing the dataset for character classification. It includes tasks such as data collection, image preprocessing, and dataset organization to ensure the neural network receives properly formatted input.

2. Automatic Segmentation and Neural Network Classification
   - Implementations: `Character_Classification_AutomaticSegmentation.ipynb`, `Character_Classification_NeuralNetwork.ipynb`
   - Description: These notebooks contain the implementations for automatic segmentation of license plate characters and the three-layered neural network for character classification. The segmentation algorithm extracts individual characters from the license plates, and the neural network is trained to classify these characters accurately.

## Conclusion
